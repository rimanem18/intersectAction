## Code guidelines
- Keep things simple and minimal
- Please write clear, readable code
- Comments are welcome, especially for tricky parts
- No need to follow strict style rules—just make it understandable

## Commit message conventions
To keep things clean and readable, we use the following prefixes in commit messages:

- add: for new features or files
- fix: for bug fixes
- docs: for documentation updates
- refactor: for code restructuring without changing behavior
- style: for formatting-only changes (spaces, commas, etc.)
- chore: for tooling, config files, and other maintenance

**Example:**  
`add: test.html with fade-in animation for intersection demo`

## Pull Requests
- Small PRs are welcome!
- Please write a short, clear description of your changes
- You can open a draft PR if you're still working on it
